    <p>  Tigers are a very wild animal. They hunt for many things
      big and small. when tigers get together they mate and then
      go seperate ways. A female tiger makes 2 to 3 cubs. The female tiger
      raises the cubs alone. After two years  tigers gain independence.
      Some tigers that live in the wild rest more in the
        day and hunt at night.  </p>

  <p> Tigers are big animals that like to eat all sizes of animals, but thier favorite food are : deer,
    buffalo, bison, tapir, orangutan, monkeys, camels, fish, and wild boars. Even if those are their
    favorites they might not be around so they will eat  dogs, crocodiles, leopards, and sloth bears.</p>

  <h3>How they hunt their food</h3>
  <p>Tigers get their food by trying to ambush their prey. They will quietly follow their prey then
    jump on them to capture it's food. But because some tigers too old to hunt or injured they tend to
    try and get humans. So beware if you can.</p>
