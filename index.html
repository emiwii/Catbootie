<p> In my websites you can learn about cats and tigers.
The reason why I wrote about them is because I really like felines. Sometimes I think
they can be very quiet and calm. My love for cats grew when I was five years old. When I had my
cats I was very curious. They were too. Until now they are still the same cats I had my entire life.
But for making this website my sisters helped me make it even though they were busy doing work.
I have been working on this since quarantine. It has given me a lot of time to do this even thought
I have to do school work. Working on this makes me happy to know that others will soon see my webiste.
I hope that maybe reading this will make you love cats too.  - Emily Thach (creator of website)
