  <h1> A PURRFECT WEBSITE ABOUT CATS </h1>

<p> Hello this is my website about cats! You will be learning about
  their behavior, diet, and some facts about them!<p>
<p> </p>

  <h2> BEHAVIOR/ PHISCYLE TRAITS</h2>
  <p> Cats sleep between 12 to 16 hours a day, so if you are not a morning person then
    your sprit animal is probably a cat. </p>
  <p> Have you ever seen your cat sniff something and alaways disappeer while you are
    not looking? Well Cats are very curious about evrything. Once you go they make sure you
    are not near by sniffing and listening for a couple of minutes. Cats also hide some of their favorite things like
    their toys.</p>
    <p>Some cats act like dogs for example Ragdoll cats. They are very playful and they can learn how to play fetch.Some cats don't like dogs but some do.
      If they don't like a dog then they usually arch their back and hiss.</p>
      <p> Did you know that if a cat curls their tail around you that means they are giving you a hug?</p>

    <h2>Diet</h2>
    <p> Cats are meat eaters. They get their protien from meat for a strong heart,
      good vision,,and a good reproductive system.


    <h2>FACTS</h2>
